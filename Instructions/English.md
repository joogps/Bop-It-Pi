### The game
Bop It! Pi is a game made for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), built on the [Processing Programming Language](https://processing.org/) and that makes use of the board's [General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) pins. It was inspired by [Bop It! Smash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bop_It#Bop-It!_Smash), a toy made by [Hasbro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro).

### How to play it
The game consists on trying to get the greatest score you can without losing your lives on doing it. The LEDs will flash like a ball bouncing from side to side. You need to press two keys on your keyboard or press both of the connected push buttons to catch it. The yellow and red LEDs make you lose a heart, while the blue LED (the one in the center) recovers one. The score you get for each catch also depends on the color of the LED where the "ball" stops on. Ideas for a new game mechanic? Questions? You can report them to me [here](https://github.com/joogps/Bop-It-Pi/issues)!

### What you will need: 
- A Raspberry Pi of any model (the one shown in the tutorial will be the Raspberry Pi Model 2 v1.1);
- A double-sided breadboard*;
- 2 red LEDs**;
- 2 yellow LEDs**;
- 2 green LEDs**;
- 1 blue LED**;
- 7 330ohm resistors;
- 11 male to female jumper wires (3 of them are optional);
- 9 male to male jumper wires (2 of them are optional);
- The Processing code available [here](https://github.com/joogps/Bop-It-Pi/tree/master/Game);
- 2 push buttons (optional).

__\*__ You can manage to build the circuit on a single-sided breadboard as well, but the explanation will be based on a double-sided one. <br>
__\*\*__ The LEDs don't need to necessarily be red, green, yellow and blue. The only thing that matters is wether not you arrange them properly. You can also edit the code to add more LEDs to the project, remove some of them if the ones you have aren't enough or maybe even edit their conections with the GPIO interface.

#### Placing the buttons (optional)
If you want to, you can use push buttons instead of keys to play the game. Below is a tutorial showing you how to put them on your circuit.

<table> 
	<tr> <td> <b>1.</b> Grab your circuit and turn off your Raspberry Pi </td> <td> <a href="Circuit/Buttons/Step1.png"><img src="Circuit/Buttons/Step1.png" alt="Explanatory image for step 1"></img></a> </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> <b>2.</b> Simetrically place the buttons on your breadboard. Make sure they cross the frontier between the sides of your board. </td> <td> <a href="Circuit/Buttons/Step2.png"><img src="Circuit/Buttons/Step2.png" alt="Explanatory image for step 2"></img></a> </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> <b>3.</b> Using a male to female jumper wire, make a connection between any 5V pin on your Raspberry Pi and the positive (red) column of your breadboard. </td> <td> <a href="Circuit/Buttons/Step3.png"><img src="Circuit/Buttons/Step3.png" alt="Explanatory image for step 3"></img></a> </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> <b>4.</b> Connect one of the legs of each button with the positive column of your breadboard using male to male jumper wires. </td> <td> <a href="Circuit/Buttons/Step4.png"><img src="Circuit/Buttons/Step4.png" alt="Explanatory image for step 4"></img></a> </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> <b>5.</b> Connect the remaining leg of each button to the Raspberry Pi on the respective pins:
		<ul>
			<li>GPIO4 (pin 7)</li>
			<li>GPIO5 (pin 29)</li>
		</ul> 
	</td> <td> <a href="Circuit/Buttons/Step5.png"><img src="Circuit/Buttons/Step5.png" alt="Explanatory image for step 5"></img></a> </td> </tr>
	<tr> <td> <b>6.</b> It's done! Now you can play Bop-It-Pi using either the keys on your keyboard or the push buttons you've just placed!</td> <td> <a href="Circuit/Buttons/Step6.jpg"><img src="Circuit/Buttons/Step6.jpg" alt="Image of a physically built circuit (with buttons)"></img></a> </td> </tr>
