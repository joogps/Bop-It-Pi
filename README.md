### The game
Bop-It Pi is a game made for the Raspberry Pi using the Processing programming language. it was inspired by Bop It! Smash, a toy made by Hasbro. The game consists on trying to get the greatest score you can without losing any life while doing it. The LEDs will flash like a jumping ball. You need to press a key on your keyboard to catch it. The blue LED (the one in the center) recovers one heart, while the yellow and red LEDs make you lose one. The score you get for each catch also depends on the color of the "ball".

### What you will need: 
- A Raspberry Pi of any model
- 2 red LEDs*
- 2 yellow LEDs*
- 2 green LEDs*
- 1 blue LED*
- 7 330ohm resistors
- 15 jumper wires

\*The LEDs don't need to necessarily be red, green, yellow and blue. The only thing that matters is wether not you arrange them properly.
